// The only restriction the thief has is that he canâ€™t steal from two consecutive houses,
// as that would alert the security system. How should the thief maximize his stealing?

//Input: {2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4}
//Output: 15
//Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 5 + 6 + 4

//Input: {2, 10, 14, 8, 1}
//Output: 18
//Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 10 + 8
