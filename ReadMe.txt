Binary Tree
1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l-1.
2) Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is (2^h) – 1.
3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  ? Log2(N+1) ?
4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least   ? Log2L ? + 1   levels
